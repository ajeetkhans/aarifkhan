======================================
How many french fries (60rs per piece) do you want to order ?
How many burgers (50rs per piece) do you want to order ?
How many plates of chowmin (100rs per plate) do you want to order?
How many plates of Manchurian (80rs per plate) do you want to order?

If number is odd then print Odd
If number is even then print Even
If number is 100 then print 100
Else print 10000
