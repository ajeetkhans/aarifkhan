======================================
How many french fries (60rs per piece) do you want to order ?
How many burgers (50rs per piece) do you want to order ?
How many plates of chowmin (100rs per plate) do you want to order?
How many plates of Manchurian (80rs per plate) do you want to order?

=======================================================
Using a switch case to do this exercise

If number is odd then print Odd
If number is even then print Even
If number is 100 then print 100
Else print 10000

1. Function ko 1 number pass krna hai. jo number pass kia hai us number ki table print krni hai. for example 5 
5*1=5
5*2=10

2. Function ko 2 numbers pass krne hai. Numbers ko multiply krna hai 

3. Function ko array bnana hai and array ke sare numbers ko print krna hai 

4. Function bnana hai. Function me ek value leni hai. agar value true hai to Yes print kro otherwise No print kro

5. Function bnana hai. Function ko 2 numbers pass krne hai min and max. for example 10 and 20 to tume 10 se leke 20 tak print krvana hai 

6. function bnana hai. Function ko 1 number pass krna hai. 0 se leke us number tak jitne b Odd numbers hai vo print krne hai.

7. function bnana hai. Function ko 1 number pass krna hai. 0 se leke us number tak jitne b Even numbers hai vo print krne hai.

8. Ek function bnana hai. Is function ko 2 number pas krne hai. phla number ek number hoga aur dusra number maximum number hoga. fir hume phle number ke multiples max number tak print krne hai.

for example: 5, 100
5 10 15 20 25...... 100

1. function oddEven(num) yadi number odd hai to Odd word return kro otherwise Even word return kro 
2. function max(arr) max number find krke return krna hai 
3. function min(arr) min number find krke return krna hai 
4. function minAndMax(arr) min and max number find krke dono ko plus krke return krna hai 
5. function minAndMaxArr(arr) ek new array bnana hai usme 0 index pr to min number store krna hai and 1 index pr maximum number ko store krvake array ko return krna hai 
6. function reverseString(str) function ko ek string pass krni hai. is string ko reverse krke return krna hai 
for example: My name is Wecode 
output: Wecode is name My 
7. function maskMobile(mobileNumber, start, end, char, total)
maskMobile(9581894461, yes, false, '*', 5)
output: ***94461
maskMobile(9581894461, false, yes, '*', 5)
output: 95818***
maskMobile(9581894461, false, false, '*', 5)
output: 9581894461
8. Replace all words in a string 

function replaceString(str, word, newWord) 

replaceString("Hello my name is Wecode and is hello test", "is", "are")
output: Hello my name are Wecode and are hello test
